'], 'document': [' COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: WHAT KIND OF PARTNER IS MEXICO?; THROUGH NAFTA, THE  U.S. IS ENTITLED -- OBLIGATED -- TO ASK ABOUT PEASANTS\\' HUMAN RIGHTS.     During his debate with Ross Perot on the North American Free Trade Agreement,  Vice President Al Gore conceded that \"Mexico is not yet a full democracy,\" and  that \"they do not yet have full protection for human rights.\" But he assured  his audience that \"they\\'ve been making tremendous progress, and the progress  has been associated with this new relationship with the United States.\"     During his December trip to Mexico to meet with President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari, Gore ducked questions about rigged elections in a country that has had  one-party rule for 60 years by telling reporters, \"The question is whether or  not we will have the ability to influence what they and their government  decide.\"     OK, then why the deafening silence from the Clinton Administration about the  Indian uprising in southern Mexico? Grave issues of human rights have been  raised by reports of summary executions by the army, indiscriminate bombing of  the countryside and the strafing of journalists. Has the President no words of  caution on this?     The rebels also singled out NAFTA as potentially exacerbating their people\\'s  troubles, so a response from President Clinton is in order. After all, he  promised that NAFTA would usher in a bright new day for all on both sides of  the border; shouldn\\'t he now respond to the fears of desperately poor people  that their lot will only get worse?      The President is further obligated to speak out because the exploitation of  indigenous people is widely recognized as a major source of human-rights  violations worldwide. It is a cruel irony that during 1993, proclaimed as the  Year of Indigenous Peoples, attacks on the earliest nurturers of the earth have  accelerated.     Amnesty International reports that the estimated 300 million indigenous people  who reside in 70 countries are the \"most defenseless of all the victims of  human-rights violations.\"     These people have tended to suffer much from the rapid expansion of market  forces, which all U.S. administrations celebrate as an unequivocal triumph of  democracy. At best, as the Mexican case illustrates, they are left behind in  pockets of extreme poverty; at worst, their resources are pillaged and their  populations decimated.     That the destruction of indigenous peoples is a hemisphere-wide phenomenon is  witnessed by the recent massacre of the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela, many of  them children and women, at the hands of rapacious Brazilian gold miners.      In Brazil, Amnesty International reports, the abuse of indigenous people is  widespread, the government is indifferent and one-third of the tribes have  vanished.      But it is not only indigenous people who are the victims of economic  \"progress\" that is measured by foreign investment dollars and growth in the  aggregate GNP rather than the distribution of wealth among the general  population.     Brazil, long the most robust economy in Latin America -- a major magnet for  international investors and much celebrated in the world media as a free-market  success story -- has 60 million people living in abject poverty. Anyone who has  ventured into the shantytowns that abut the luxury hotels and gleaming new  office towers of Rio and Sao Paulo knows that economic growth has very much  enlarged the enormous chasm between rich and poor.     Simply put, it\\'s the class struggle, stupid. Whether it be in Mexico, where  half of the people live in misery, or Brazil, the rising tide of foreign  investment does not lift all boats. Those stuck in the muck of poverty can  witness the success of others and, as with the peasant guerrillas of Chiapas,  try to do something about it.     Far better the ballot than the gun. But throughout the hemisphere, political  democracy is mocked by an ever-prosperous elite that can buy government favor  and blot out the cries of the desperate.     The United States can do something about this. As the President has belatedly  learned in regard to Russia, an economic policy that emphasizes the private  market while excluding the needs of those who can\\'t effectively play in it is a  prescription for disaster. Now the President will urge Boris Yeltsin to pay  more attention to Russia\\'s social safety net and indeed will offer some  financing toward that end. Ought we not do the same for countries in our own  back yard?     The revolt of the Indians of Chiapas should be a wake-up call. Like it or not,  the passage of NAFTA tied the Administration to the politics of the ruling  party of Mexico. On Dec. 2, Gore told a gathering of Mexican businessmen that  NAFTA represents \"a starting point for dealing with the common challenges of  the Americas.\" Certainly closing the gap between rich and poor and between  dominant and indigenous cultures should be at the top of the list.  ', ' WORLD VIEW; THE LITTLEST VICTIMS OF GLOBAL \\'PROGRESS\\'; IRONICALLY, CHILDREN ARE  BEING THREATENED BY ECONOMIC REFORMS, THE NEW POLITICS AND ADVANCES IN  TECHNOLOGY.     Under the bridge in Klong Toey\\'s massive slum and around Bangkok\\'s railway  station, Thai boys gather nightly. Preteen labor is illegal in Thailand, but  these kids work in shoe factories, gas stations or fisheries, even heavy labor.  Others are child prostitutes or live off petty crime. Many are homeless.      The boys roughhouse, play with popguns and wait for \"tricks,\" victims or  employers who look for cheap labor at the rail station. Sniffing glue and paint  thinner is now chronic in this age group.     Child labor has long been a problem in Asia, but social workers claim figures  are soaring, despite government efforts, as Thailand presses to join the list  of newly industrialized countries, or NICs.     \"Becoming an NIC is destroying the social fabric of this society. And the kids  are paying the highest price,\" said Rotjana Phraesrithong of the Foundation for  Slum Child Care in Klong Toey.     *     In Latvia, the children show up in Riga\\'s quaintly restored old town in the  late afternoon. None looks older than about 7. Among a group of four boys, one  has no socks and all wear only light sweaters, despite the cold in northern  Europe.     With their hands outstretched, the boys trail people leaving Latvia\\'s new  privatized hotels, boutiques and restaurants. Late at night, they loiter under  the bright lights of a new casino. Both Latvian and Russian children now beg on  Riga\\'s streets, explained Dmitri Yeryomin, a young interpreter, with  embarrassment.     \"This is all new to us. We didn\\'t have beggars in the past. In the Communist  days, the state took care of everyone,\" Yeryomin added. \"Now it\\'s everyone for  himself.\"     *     For all of its scientific and technical advances, the world at the end of the  20th Century is producing millions of children who have little hope of normal  life, much less of leading the world into the 21st.     And many of the underlying causes today are otherwise-heralded forces of  global change: new free markets, new political systems and new rights of people  to speak, act or associate freely, and of nations to determine their own  destiny.     \"The view that the Cold War has gone out with a whimper rather than a bang,  and that one side has won with hardly a shot being fired, is the first and most  dangerous placebo of the new age,\" according to \"The State of the World\\'s  Children 1994,\" the yearly survey of the U.N. Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF). (See  chart on Page 5.)     \"The Cold War has been more destructive than any war in human history; it has  been a war in which there have been no winners and a war of which the severest  consequences may yet be to come.\"     The picture is not all bleak, of course. Unprecedented breakthroughs were made  during the Cold War. Indeed, until the late 1980s the 3 billion children  worldwide had never been better off by many measures.     Since World War II, deaths of children under 5 have been halved. The number of  Third World children who start school has risen from less than half to more  than 75% -- despite a doubling of the population. And 60% of rural families now  have access to safe water -- up from less than 10%, UNICEF said.     Just since the mid-1980s, the largest peacetime collaboration in history has  provided child immunization throughout the developing world. The program saves  about 10,000 lives a day, more than 3 million a year, UNICEF reports. Deaths  from measles, for example, dropped from 2.5 million in 1980 to about a million  a year now.     Overall, 70% to 80% of all children now have their basic needs in health and  sanitation met, according to Save the Children. Laws on issues such as  maternity leave and working conditions are also giving new attention and weight  to children\\'s rights worldwide.     Among the most progressive is Norway\\'s law allowing a mother to take a year  off work at 80% pay after birth -- or the same conditions for a father if the  mother opts to return to work.     \"We have made more global human progress in the last 50 years than in the  previous 2000. Three-quarters of the world\\'s population now enjoy the basics of  a life of dignity, productivity and health,\" said James P. Grant, UNICEF\\'s  executive director.     At the same time, however, many changes since the great, global,  sociopolitical upheaval that began in 1989 are seriously threatening progress.  The new world order is turning out to be particularly hard on the young.     First and foremost, children are increasingly victims in a growing pattern of  internal urban conflict on four continents.     In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the plight of 5-year-old Irma Hadzimuratovic, her body  torn by shrapnel in an attack that killed her mother, inspired an airlift last  summer -- though not until after hundreds of other children died. (Despite  treatment in London, Irma was paralyzed.)     Post-Cold War turmoil is also leaving deep scars on children from tiny  Tajikistan in the former Soviet bloc to huge Zaire in the belly of Africa, from  exotic Kashmir to mountainous Afghanistan.      After the superpowers stopped exploiting its territorial and tribal divisions  for surrogate conflict, Angola\\'s civil strife grew even nastier, reputedly  killing about 1,000 children monthly in 1993. Since the Soviet demise, children  have been hostages in the conflict between Christian Armenians and Muslim  Azerbaijanis over Nagorno-Karabakh.     \"Many of the dreams of the post-Cold War era were put on hold as rivals in a  host of countries pursued ethnic, religious, territorial and political  differences at the point of a gun. Children were among the first to suffer,\"  UNICEF warned in a recent report. Victims of War      The dangers in post-Cold War hot spots aren\\'t just physical. For children,  \"the psychological damage caused by war can be even more devastating,\" UNICEF  added. About 70,000 children remain in Sarajevo, while a million refugees from  Yugoslavia\\'s multifaceted conflict are under 18. Whether injured, threatened or  forced to flee, all face trauma from loss of health, family, home or country.     By mid-1993, the rape of Bosnian women by Serbian forces -- atrocities  redefining the term \"child victims\" -- led to the births of hundreds of babies,  nearly all of whom face life as outcasts.     On top of 18 million refugees, post-Cold War upheavals have led to the  displacement of about 25 million people within their own countries. At least  half in both categories are children, according to Judy Mayotte, chairwoman of  the Women\\'s Commission for Refugee Women and Children in New York.     \"Internally displaced children are a glaring problem that has grown with  global change since the 1980s. But they don\\'t have the recognition as refugees  because they\\'re supposedly protected by a government -- which is often party to  the problem,\" Mayotte said.     \"This is going to be the situation in a lot of places in the post-Cold War  world, as other uprisings and internal conflicts break out, and as countries  refuse or turn back refugees.\"     Hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled northern Iraq after a failed 1991 uprising  against President Saddam Hussein -- only to be held at the Turkish and Iranian  borders. Children particularly succumbed to malnutrition, disease and  frostbite.     Due to problems from societal breakdowns, UNICEF spent $170 million in 1992 on  humanitarian aid in more than 50 states -- the most since the post-World War II  emergency and three times the 1990 level. No More Safety Net      Abrupt political transitions are also weakening or eliminating the safety net  of state protection. Economic reforms are unleashing cutthroat competition, an  intense new version of survival of the fittest. And social transformations are  altering rules of the game. Again, children often bear the brunt.     In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc, transitions from socialist rule  have removed everything from guaranteed incomes to state health and welfare  services, affecting children the most.     Many now face problems virtually unknown during seven decades of socialist  rule, from medical neglect allowing old diseases like polio to make big  comebacks in Bulgaria to the homelessness forcing children to camp out and  panhandle in Russian subways.     Since the 1989 revolution, poverty has become so pervasive in Romania that  most families spend 80% of their income on food, and about 4,000 children were  left at orphanages in 1992. After years of declines, the rate of infant  mortality rose 3% -- and is now more than double the European average, the  Health Ministry said.     \"The post-Cold War world is not better for millions of children. They\\'re less  protected than before, and they\\'re more vulnerable due to political and  economic transitions,\" said Horst Habenicht, who runs the International Labor  Organization\\'s (ILO) new International Program on the Elimination of Child  Labor.     \"The transition from planned economies to private market economies often means  the social framework no longer exists in these countries, so there\\'s little  protection for people in general, and often none for children at all.\"     Transitions from right-wing rule in Latin America, much of which became  democratic for the first time in 1991, have also marred children\\'s lives.     Peru is a classic case. New freedoms have not resulted in greater prosperity.  Foreign debt, privatization and stiffer economic competition from free-market  forces have instead increased poverty. Five million children, nearly a quarter  of the entire population, now live in extreme poverty, UNICEF reported.     \"A major challenge in the 1990s is to find ways to make structural adjustments  with a human face to cushion the vulnerable parts of society from the drastic  effects of economic transitions,\" said Ken Kloten, executive director of  Defense for Children International.     \"We want these adjustments to ensure a free citizenry and for continued growth  of democracy around the world -- which is good for kids. But it will require  resources, and we\\'re living at a time that dollars are increasingly scarce for  development aid.\"     One byproduct is a growing class of uneducated outcasts who prey on the system  to survive. The magnitude is numbing. In Latin America, a record 40 million  children are abandoned or homeless. Seven million are in Brazil, the World  Health Organization said.     Nairobi\\'s young street population rose from 16,000 in 1989 to 25,000, the U.N.  Development Program reported. In Manila, 75,000 children are homeless, while  Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi each have 100,000. Numbers are also soaring in  Eastern Europe.     As numbers grow, public sympathy wanes and backlash widens. \"Street children  are automatically regarded as criminal suspects by many law officers and are  often subjected to harassment, threats or violent attacks,\" Amnesty  International reported.     Last July, eight Brazilian boys, ages 11 to 17, were shot in cold blood in Rio  de Janeiro. Four police officers were arrested for their murders. Since 1990,  about 4,600 street children have been killed in Brazil.     \"These children are a product of the breakdown of family support systems that  come with population growth and migration to cities. As grim as life was in  many villages, at least children had an extended family to rely on and a  traditional way of life that gave meaning to their existence,\" said Dr. Charles  MacCormack, president of Save the Children.     Brazil isn\\'t alone. As part of an anti-crime campaign by vigilantes, Colombian  posters announced the \"extermination of delinquents\" and invited Bogota\\'s  10,000 vagrant children to attend their own funerals in 1993, according to  Amnesty International. In 1991 alone, about 2,800 children were murdered in  Colombia, Amnesty added.      Worldwide, according to Defense for Children International, youngsters were  victims of extrajudicial or arbitrary executions in 22 states last year. Back  to Work      Another characteristic of the new order is that after declining for decades,  the frequency of child labor is again on the increase, particularly in the  developing world. The ILO estimates that one in four children between the ages  of 10 and 14 now work in Third World countries. The total is in the hundreds of  millions.     On a still-sweltering winter day, Klong Toey\\'s clay dirt alleys were empty of  children. Only toddlers, some with childhood pigtails, played outside. Mothers  were in short supply, too. At least 5 million Thai children, beginning at age  7, now work, said Chira Hongladarom, executive director of Bangkok\\'s Human  Resources Institute. More than 60% of Thai mothers also work.     \"Economic growth over the past seven years has had a negative impact on the  social system, particularly family structure. Children, now part of the  productive process, are treated as economic goods rather than society\\'s  future,\" he said.     \"The trend is happening despite -- or perhaps because of -- the modernizing  process of international trade and investment,\" added Robert Sensor in a 1993  Freedom House report. In many NICs, human rights are secondary to economics in  the name of development.     Children reportedly constitute 18% of Brazil\\'s work force. Child labor is  widespread in Africa, particularly in agriculture. An estimated 12 million  children work in populous Nigeria.      But Asia has the most child labor. In India alone, 44 million children work,  the ILO estimates. One of four Indian workers is under age 14.      In Indonesia, conservative figures claim that 2.4 million children between  ages 10 and 14 work. Along China\\'s eastern provinces, site of an economic boom,  children have left school in droves for jobs in new factories, Sensor said. The  problem was illustrated dramatically in a 1992 fire at a fireworks factory:  most of 20 workers killed were between 9 and 14 years old.     The issue is not just age, but conditions and pay. In Thailand, girls work  12-hour days in textile shops. They earn as little as 5 cents for sewing on 100  buttons, or 10 cents for wrapping 100 silk flower stems, according to Bangkok\\'s  Foundation for Child Development. One-third work for less than minimum wage,  Hongladarom added.     \"Child labor is the single most important source of child abuse and child  exploitation in the world,\" according to Michel Hansenne, ILO director general.     Again, new freedoms have contributed to the problem. \"In socialist systems,  the state organized work and excluded children. Now, free markets and private  employers try to get the cheapest labor. With the state\\'s role diminished, and  no social protection or legislation in place, child labor is growing,\"  Habenicht said.     Many countries in transition still haven\\'t finished new constitutions or basic  reforms, so meaningful legislation codifying children\\'s rights, treatment and  living or working conditions is a decade or more away. Enforcement will take  even longer, he said.     The problem of child labor, however, has an even darker side. In the late 20th  Century, 200 million child laborers work in slavery, forced child labor or debt  bondage, an ILO study reported.     Slave raiders in Asia, Africa and Latin America kidnap or buy children into  lifelong bondage, it charged. Slaves as young as 6 work up to 18 hours a day.  In Haiti, more than 100,000 children, known as restaveks, have been sold or  given away to work as domestics.     The most common form of slave labor is child prostitution. India reportedly  has up to 400,000 child prostitutes, Brazil a quarter of a million, the  Philippines 60,000 and Sri Lanka 30,000, many sold by families or trapped by  debt bondage. In Thailand, at least 800,000 girls, some as young as 8, work as  prostitutes.     Pakistan has up to 7.5 million children in modern slavery, the ILO reported.  In India, several million children between ages 5 and 14 are in \"chronic  bondage\" in agriculture, a million in construction, brick-making and quarry  work, and several hundred thousand in carpet and jewelry industries, according  to Kailash Satyarthi, chairman of South Asia Coalition on Child Servitude.     In Brazil, escravidade branca, or white slavery, is common in rural areas,  while debt bondage -- enganche or \"the hook\" -- is a problem in Peru\\'s mines,  the ILO said. Treated as \"expendable,\" child slaves worldwide often get  dangerous jobs. Education or prospects of betterment are nonexistent. Any  semblance of childhood disappears. Technology and Disease      Technological developments and new health plagues in the late 20th Century are  also leaving a lasting impact on children.     One of the worst manifestations was the 1993 birth in Moldova of a baby with  two heads, two hearts, two lungs, two spinal cords but one set of limbs.  Doctors blamed it on radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster  in neighboring Ukraine. Doctors in the area reported up to a 30% increase in  birth defects as well as a dramatic rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer  among children after Chernobyl.      Because technology now discerns gender, children elsewhere don\\'t have a chance  at life; thousands of Chinese and Indian women abort female fetuses in  societies favoring boys.      The AIDS pandemic, spread globally in a relatively short time thanks to modern  transportation, is both killing children and creating orphans.     Among the offspring of HIV-positive pregnant women, one out of three babies is  likely to be infected and eventually die of AIDS; two will be orphaned when the  mothers die, said Mechai Viravaidya, chairman of Bangkok\\'s Population and  Community Development Assn.     Uganda has produced 1.5 million AIDS orphans in the past decade. In Thailand,  10,000 pregnant, HIV-positive women in 1992 were expected to eventually produce  6,500 orphans -- doubling in a year the total number of orphans under state  care for other reasons. In 1993, pregnant and HIV-positive Thai women doubled  to 20,000, Viravaidya said.     One of AIDS\\' most lasting legacies may be a world awash with a generation of  orphans. A UNICEF report, \"AIDS: The Second Decade,\" estimates nearly 10  million children will be orphaned by AIDS by 2000 -- a prediction some experts  now believe to be conservative.     Yet children\\'s problems at the close of the 20th Century are most distinctive  because they\\'re largely preventable. Most of the 13 million child deaths in  1992, for example, could have been avoided.      \"Somewhere between 500 million and 1 billion children are still facing  malnutrition, disease and death, mainly because we can\\'t mobilize what we need  to help them,\" MacCormack of Save the Children said.     \"It was understandable when we didn\\'t have solutions. But now we know what to  do. One of the greatest frustrations is to know technology and management are  there to eliminate 60% to 70% of remaining child poverty at a reasonable cost,  but the political will and public knowledge aren\\'t there to make it happen.\"     And dangers grow as nations both big and small engage in economic and social  triage. In 1993, for example, Washington eliminated aid to 21 states, many  where children endure the worst conditions.     \"We\\'ve hit a plateau in our ability to reduce many problems because we\\'re  using the same or fewer resources than in the past,\" Kloten said.     \"Between resource problems and global change, the situation in many places  will get worse before it gets better.\"  ', ' MEXICO ACCUSED OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DURING REVOLT; REPORT: AMNESTY  INTERNATIONAL SAYS SOLDIERS TERRORIZED INDIAN VILLAGERS. ARMY HAS DENIED  VIOLATING THE LAW, BUT GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO HELP WITH PROBE.     A leading human rights group charged Monday that Mexican soldiers terrorized  Indian villages -- beating, torturing and kidnaping inhabitants -- in the  aftermath of the New Year\\'s uprising in the southern state of Chiapas.     Amnesty International investigators, in a report expected late Monday, accused  the army of gross human rights violations and cited disappearances and summary  executions among the abuses.     Attempts to probe suspected executions have been stifled by the government\\'s  failure to allow foreign forensics experts to examine bodies or autopsy files,  according to the report.     The government has also refused to exhume corpses from 48 unmarked graves in a  cemetery in the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, said investigators from other  human rights groups.     The army has issued blanket statements denying any violations of the law but  refused repeated requests for information about specific charges.     The charges came as U.S. and Canadian politicians and citizens groups are  questioning their countries\\' closer economic ties to a government that may have  permitted brutalization of civilians in its efforts to put down the rebellion  by an estimated 2,000 Indians.     Amnesty investigators said about 70 Indians are being held without charge in  the Chiapas state prison. Most claim to be victims of army roundups of  villagers suspected to have ties to the Zapatista National Liberation Army, the  rebels who on New Year\\'s Day took over four county seats in Chiapas, an  impoverished state on the Guatemalan border.     As the guerrillas pulled out of the towns into the jungle a few days later, an  estimated 15,000 troops moved in. The army closed off the roads into formerly  rebel-held areas and, according to eyewitness accounts cited by Amnesty, began  a brutal search for insurgents.     Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) has scheduled a hearing for Feb. 2 on  allegations of army abuses. Clinton Administration officials have also  expressed concerns that Mexico is not demonstrating the sensitivity to human  rights that they would expect from a partner in the North American Free Trade  Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1.     The government struck a conciliatory tone toward the rebels after a chorus of  national and international protests greeted the army\\'s attempts to defeat them  during the first week of the uprising.     That change in strategy came after Jan. 7, the morning soldiers entered the  village of Morelia, near the previously occupied town of Altamirano, residents  told Amnesty investigators.     That day, the men of Morelia were assembled and told to lie face down on the  basketball court that also serves as the town square, townspeople said. Three  men were taken into the church; their screams could be heard for the next three  hours.     According to the Amnesty report, the men were then taken away in an army  ambulance, one of them bleeding profusely, and have not been seen since.     Another group was taken to the state prison, where Amnesty investigators  interviewed them Friday. The rest lay on the court until the soldiers left at  about 6 p.m.     \"There was a general brutalization of people,\" said Amnesty investigator  Carlos Salinas.     The human rights group based its findings on photos of bodies, interviews with  villagers and a visit to the state prison, he said. Following a week of futile  attempts, human rights workers were allowed into the prison Friday after  Torricelli complained directly to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is  not related to the human rights investigator.     Interviews with prisoners also provided important evidence, said human rights  activist Salinas, that seven bodies found in the market of another town,  Ocosingo, site of the rebellion\\'s fiercest fighting, were victims of  executions.     The bodies were found lined up with their hands behind their backs and bullet  wounds in their heads.     Prisoners reported having been bound with yellow cord similar to that found  next to the Ocosingo bodies, and cuts on their wrists were similar to those in  photographs of the corpses, Salinas said.     Amnesty had to base its report on photos taken by the first news photographers  to arrive in Ocosingo after the fighting, because the government\\'s National  Human Rights Commission refused to let the organization see autopsy reports.  ', ' CONFRONTING THE STAIN OF CHIAPAS; WITH ARMY\\'S BRUTALITY NEWLY DOCUMENTED,  SALINAS VOWS TO AID INDIANS     Mexico\\'s capable young President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is struggling  mightily to refurbish his country\\'s image, so badly damaged by an Indian  uprising Jan. 1 in the state of Chiapas and the army\\'s heavy-handedness in  putting it down.     Salinas took a big step in the right direction Tuesday when he visited that  impoverished southern state and promised to act to solve the deep social and  economic problems there. But the impact of his gesture was undermined by a  report issued the same day by a respected human rights group that documents  just how harsh the army\\'s repression of the rebels was.     Salinas genuinely wants an end to the crisis in Chiapas, where at least 100  have died in the violence. He reorganized his Cabinet, fired the state\\'s  governor, ordered an army cease-fire and offered the rebels amnesty. Last  weekend, in a show of how widespread sympathy for the rebels is among even  pro-government Mexicans, that nation\\'s Congress unanimously approved the  president\\'s amnesty plan.     Salinas carried the amnesty declaration with him Tuesday, telling an audience  of indigenous and peasant leaders, \"We want peace, but not a return to the  situation before.\" He also promised economic aid for war victims and to help  bring Chiapas\\' largely rural population closer to the rest of Mexico in terms  of the nation\\'s rising level of development. But before he delivers long-term  economic aid to the people of Chiapas, Salinas must respond to their more  immediate human rights concerns. For despite repeated promises by government  officials to withdraw troops from Chiapas villages, many places remain occupied  and subject to often arbitrary repression.     Tuesday\\'s report on the uprising -- in which 15,000 heavily armed troops put  down a rebel force of 2,000 Indians -- was issued by Amnesty International. Its  investigators were told of nine executions of suspected rebels and of dozens of  men being detained and sometimes tortured simply because they were suspected of  being rebel sympathizers. The whereabouts of many detainees are still unknown.  Until Salinas addresses these concerns of the indigenous people of Chiapas, the  crisis there will not be over.  ', ' U.S. OFFICIALS PLAY DOWN ABUSES IN MEXICO UPRISING     State Department officials acknowledged on Wednesday that \"some human rights  abuses may have occurred\" after last month\\'s peasant uprising in Mexico, but  they asserted that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari responded in \"a  forthcoming and responsible way.\"     In the Clinton Administration\\'s first public testimony on the insurrection in  the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, officials said they had been assured  that those found guilty of abuses will be punished.     But other witnesses at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing took a  harsher view of events in Chiapas, where 2,000 members of the Zapatista  National Liberation Army took control of four county seats on New Year\\'s Day  before relinquishing control several days later.     Fernando Hernandez, a Mayan leader in Chiapas, testified that the killing and  disappearance of native people by the army \"is a common and daily occurrence.\"     Juan E. Mendez, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Americas, said  members of his group who visited Chiapas found evidence of summary executions,  disappearances and torture.     In Chiapas, Salinas\\' political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party  (PRI), \"bears little resemblance to the image of modernization . . . that  Salinas has carefully cultivated,\" Mendez said. He added that \"rural bosses  with close ties to the PRI own not only the land -- they also own the local  police, civil authorities and judges.\"     Alexander F. Watson, assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs,  said he does not wish to challenge the Mexicans\\' testimony.     But he told the Western Hemisphere subcommittee that Salinas should be  commended for \"attempting to establish a peaceful dialogue with the rebels.\"     Watson said Salinas had taken steps to resolve the crisis, including  instructing government officials on Jan. 6 \"to respect the human rights of the  civilian population.\"     A few days later, he replaced his interior minister and appointed Foreign  Minister Manuel Camacho Solis, known as a skilled negotiator, to serve as  commissioner for peace and reconciliation, Watson said.     \"A resolution of the broader problems in Chiapas will not be achieved  overnight,\" he testified. \"It is an area of deep inequalities, where powerful  landlords and local bosses have conspired to thwart the aspirations for justice  and better standards of living for the rural populations.\"     Watson also responded to critics who assert that the uprising showed Mexico to  be an unworthy economic partner of the United States in the North American Free  Trade Agreement, which the Administration pushed through Congress last year.     \"The legitimate grievances of the people of southern Mexico were neither  caused by NAFTA nor should NAFTA be in any way compromised by these  developments,\" he said. \"Indeed, the events in Chiapas demonstrated more  clearly than ever the need for NAFTA (because) Mexico will be drawn more into  the Western community of nations.\"     Amnesty International, confirming statements by the group in Mexico City last  month, gave the subcommittee a report charging the army with gross violations  of human rights -- terrorizing Indian villages and beating, torturing and  kidnaping inhabitants.     Meantime, in Mexico, officials reacted to the American hearings with  equanimity that would have been surprising only a few years ago; this, perhaps,  was a reflection of the closer U.S.-Mexican relationship.     The most critical comment came from Andres Rosenthal, undersecretary of  foreign relations, who said they \"were hardly a friendly thing to do.\"     But Senate Majority Leader Emilio M. Gonzalez said American legislators \"have  every right to express their opinions. Criticisms between countries are  inevitable.\"     Times staff writer Juanita Darling in Mexico City contributed to this report.  ', ' RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSES NATIONS OF FINE WORDS, FOUL DEEDS; REPORT: MANY  GOVERNMENTS ARE HYPOCRITICAL, SOME ABUSE ACTIVISTS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL STUDY  SAYS.     In a depressing report scheduled for release today on the state of human  rights around the globe, Amnesty International accused most of the world\\'s  governments of pledging support for human rights with lofty rhetoric, then  abusing human rights in practice.     Many victims, in fact, are human rights activists who are struggling against  terrible odds to tell the truth about the woeful state of human rights in their  countries, the report said. \"Governments that victimize human rights activists  almost invariably have a great deal to hide,\" Amnesty International said.     As an example of hypocrisy, the report cited South Korea, which arrested one  of its most prominent human rights advocates last year, just a few weeks after  the South Korean foreign minister told the U.N. World Conference on Human  Rights in Vienna: \"I am happy to report to you that human rights have finally  come of age in Korea.\"     \"There was a lot of official talk about human rights in 1993,\" Amnesty  International said. \"The noise reached a crescendo . . . when government  representatives met at the . . . conference. . . . But even as they were making  worthy declarations . . activists were being threatened, imprisoned, tortured  and gunned down.\"     The report, issued annually, chronicled and assessed events in 1993.     But Amnesty International, a private worldwide group of volunteers devoted to  protecting political prisoners and other human rights victims, added a  supplement to update the problems in several countries.     Summing up the situation around the globe in 1993, Amnesty International  reported more than 10,000 people -- half of them in Africa -- in 61 countries  were executed by government forces without a trial or other judicial hearing.  More than 700 people, 200 in Iraq alone, in 27 countries \"disappeared\" after  government forces took them away. Almost 4,000 prisoners were subjected to  torture, rape and other ill treatment in 112 countries, the report said.     Also, more than 600 people died of torture in 49 countries, more than 100,000  were imprisoned without charges or trial in 58 countries, and almost 2,000  prisoners, 70% of them in China, were executed in 33 countries, including 38 in  the United States. The organization is unconditionally opposed to the death  penalty, which it considers \"a gross violation of human rights.\"     In a country-by-country rundown, Amnesty International found continuation of  grave human rights violations in China, numerous killings of civilians in  Turkey by both government forces and Kurdish rebels, and continued use of  executions in the United States.     Some other findings:      * Haiti -- The military and its armed civilian auxiliaries have carried out  violations \"with complete impunity.\" A member of FRAPH -- one of the  auxiliaries -- shot 17-year-old Saurel Guerrier through the heart in January  \"because he was suspected of being connected with a children\\'s home established  by (deposed President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide.\"     Amnesty International said that more than 200 evident executions by the  military and its allies between January and May of this year are under  investigation. It also reported a surge in political rapes of \"women believed  to support President Aristide\\'s return and female relatives and friends of his  supporters.\" The victims included pregnant women and children as young as 10.     * Mexico -- After the seizure of several municipalities in Chiapas by the  Zapatista National Liberation Army in January, the report said, \"the Mexican  army arbitrarily arrested hundreds of Mexican citizens and denied them due  process. While in custody, they were ill-treated and subjected to various forms  of torture.\"     Amnesty International said 400 Mexican troops entered the village of Morelia  on Jan. 7, forcing everyone into the streets and smashing the heads of some of  the men. Three villagers were tortured for five hours and then taken away.  Their bodies were found several weeks later. Fourteen other villagers  \"disappeared\" with the troops, the report said.     * Rwanda -- Amnesty International accepted U.N. and press estimates of more  than 200,000 dead since the massacres erupted in early April. \"Some reliable  estimates put the number as high as half a million,\" the organization said. \"In  addition to the vast killings, numerous other human rights violations have been  committed.\"  ', ' AMNESTY: ORGANIZATION OF HOPE     Americans take their freedom for granted: They hear a joke about President  Clinton and Congress and they laugh. But in many other countries, as Amnesty  International, the human rights watchdog, points out in its annual report,  jokes about national leaders are no laughing matter. A wrong word about an  official can result in prison, or worse.     The London-based Amnesty International is an invaluable resource for those who  care about human rights. Though it depends on the targets of oppressive  governments for much of its information, its reports are considered highly  credible. Perhaps most significant of all its noteworthy work is the annual  report, which proves a general picture of state cruelty and oppression the  world over.     Some of the worst trouble spots are in the headlines. Haiti, Rwanda and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, not surprisingly, made the list of countries where politics  motivates killings, torture and imprisonment without benefit of trial.     In Haiti, Amnesty depended largely on the neutral reports of observers from  the United Nations and the Organization of American States to document numerous  executions of supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.     In Rwanda, Amnesty reported \"systematic and unprovoked killings of the Tutsi  minority,\" in the strife that broke out in April and noted the threat of the  massacres spreading to neighboring Burundi.     In Bosnia-Herzegovina, politics motivated hundreds of \"deliberate and  arbitrary killings\" according to Amnesty, which attributed blame to \"all  sides.\"     Amnesty is particularly valuable because it is even-handed. It notes  atrocities of oppression by both right-wing and left-wing regimes. And no  region of the world is unblemished, according to Amnesty\\'s 1994 survey of 151  countries.     Since 1961, more than a million volunteers have worked for Amnesty  International, helping in various ways to fight the execution, imprisonment and  torture of people solely because of their beliefs, religion, race, gender,  ethnic origin or politics.     This Amnesty army is essential. If such evils are made known, perhaps they  will not go unpunished; the world will respond with action rather than  rhetoric. That at any rate is the hope.  ', ' MIDEAST; TOUGH STAND ON IRAQ SANCTIONS MAY MAKE U.S. ODD MAN OUT     When the time comes every two months to review sanctions on Iraq, American  diplomats scurry about here and abroad to make sure that U.N. ambassadors and  their foreign ministries support the tough, unyielding stand of the United  States.     \"The Americans tell us that it is a matter of national security that they take  very seriously,\" an ambassador on the Security Council said. \"That is a hard  argument to oppose.\"     So the Security Council dutifully keeps the sanctions on.     But the argument may be easier to oppose if and when the U.N. Special  Commission on Iraq rules that the Saddam Hussein regime has complied with the  U.N. resolutions demanding both the destruction of all weapons of mass  destruction and perpetual inspections to ensure that these weapons are not  amassed again.     Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, who heads the commission, believes Iraq, after several  years of deceit and ornery resistance, is finally on the right track toward  compliance. He said recently he hoped to be able to report Iraq\\'s full  compliance before the end of the year.     After extensive talks in Baghdad a week ago, Ekeus and Iraqi Deputy Prime  Minister Tarik Aziz signed a joint statement that described Iraq as ready \"to  expedite the process of establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a  spirit of goodwill.\"      A literal reading of the resolutions suggests that the Security Council should  lift the embargo on Iraqi sales of oil once the Special Commission issues its  report. But U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright insists Hussein must first  establish a record of trustworthiness.     There are signs that France, the nonaligned countries on the Security Council  such as Nigeria and Djibouti, and some senior U.N. officials are losing  patience with this position.     \"Here is what is going to happen,\" said a European ambassador on the Security  Council. \"In six months or so, the Special Commission will issue a report  saying that the Iraqis have been wonderful boys, have agreed to everything, are  in full compliance, have told us everything we need to know, and so on. Then  some countries will say the Iraqis have fulfilled the letter of the law. But  the United States will insist on keeping sanctions because the Iraqis have not  shown the proper trustworthy attitude. Then there will be a confrontation.\"     The issue began soon after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The George Bush  Administration announced that, no matter what the U.N. resolutions said, it  would never vote to lift sanctions as long as Hussein was still in power.     The Clinton Administration has never gone that far. But, in practice, with the  Iraqi leader still around, Baghdad will have difficulty passing the American  test of trustworthiness.     A confrontation could present serious problems for the Administration. The  United States could prevent a majority of the Security Council from lifting  sanctions by using its veto. But that is something it has not done since the  end of the Cold War, and the Administration would probably be reluctant to use  this power.     The complex issue of Iraqi sanctions involves several resolutions and types of  sanctions. The Security Council has ordered all countries to refuse to sell  anything to Baghdad but food and medicine, and it has ordered them to refrain  from buying oil and all other exports from Iraq.     The Special Commission, headed by Ekeus since it was set up by the Security  Council in April, 1991, is charged with overseeing the destruction of all  nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and all long-range missiles; it also  must set up the ongoing inspection system.     According to the key resolution on sanctions, once the Security Council agrees  that Iraq has complied with the provisions about these weapons, the embargo on  oil and other exports \"shall have no further force or effect.\"     But other resolutions require Iraq to recognize Kuwait as a separate country,  refrain from persecuting the Kurds and other minorities, and compensate those  injured in the war. Critics maintain that Iraq\\'s record on these is worse than  its record on weapons destruction.     The Administration insists that the two sets of issues must be viewed as a  whole -- so long as Hussein is persecuting Kurds, he can\\'t be trusted to  cooperate with perpetual inspections. But some diplomats and U.N. officials  believe the American approach offers Iraq no incentive to comply with Security  Council resolutions, and they are beginning to be troubled by it.  ', ' IRAQ REPORTEDLY MASSING TROOPS IN KURDISH AREA; MILITARY: U.S. CAUTIONS BAGHDAD  AGAINST USING FORCE AGAINST POPULATION IN THE NORTHERN REGION.     Iraq has moved more than 2,000 elite troops into a largely Kurdish area north  of Baghdad, drawing a stiff warning from the United States against any military  action, senior U.S. officials said Friday.     \"The Iraqis have moved four battalions of Republican Guard infantry into the  area around Mosul,\" an official said, citing U.S. intelligence reports. \"We  want to make it clear to the Iraqi government that we will continue . . . to  enforce (United Nations) Security Council resolutions in that area. It would be  unwise of them to test our resolve.\"     The Security Council has prohibited Iraq from mounting offensive military  operations against the Kurds, a non-Arab ethnic group that is the majority of  the population in northern Iraq.     \"We have seen this kind of troop movement before, but this is a higher level  than we\\'ve seen in more than a year,\" the official said. \"Whether it is just  saber-rattling or whether he intends to challenge the U.N., we don\\'t know.\"     At the United Nations in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the  Security Council of the troop movements, a spokesman said. \"We do not know  whether (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein intends to renew his offensive against  his own people, but he clearly wishes to intimidate them, as well as the  Security Council,\" Albright said, according to her spokesman, James P. Rubin.     Albright denounced the troop movements in a closed-door Security Council  debate over a proposed statement on Iraq\\'s degree of compliance with the 1991  cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf War.     The 15-nation council agreed Wednesday to maintain economic sanctions against  Iraq but was divided over whether to praise Hussein for cooperating with U.N.  weapons inspections.     Russia, China and France supported a proposed statement that would have lauded  Iraq\\'s cooperation, but the United States and Britain were opposed.     Iraq is asking the United Nations to lift its embargo on oil exports, the  country\\'s main product. The U.N. resolutions that imposed the embargo said it  could be lifted if Iraq openly declared and destroyed all its ballistic  missiles and other weapons of mass destruction and agreed to international  monitoring. Iraq claims to have met those conditions, but the United States  disagrees.  ', ' TARIK AZIZ; IRAQ\\'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER STRUGGLES AGAINST THE U.N. EMBARGO     For a nation deeply suspicious of the outside world, Iraq has produced a  remarkable crop of diplomats. Controlled by a dictator, Saddam Hussein, who has  spent only five days outside Iraq, and run from a capital, Baghdad, that has  been described as an Arab East Berlin (before reunification), over the years  the Iraqi Foreign Service has still managed to assemble a corps of diplomats  often acknowledged to be among the best outside Europe and the Americas. In a  further anomaly, it was a Christian, Tarik Aziz, who in 1983, became this  overwhelmingly Moslem country\\'s chief foreign-policy spokesman.     First as foreign minister, and now, as deputy prime minister, the courtly,  57-year-old Aziz runs Iraq\\'s day-to-day diplomacy. Last month, he was in New  York for meetings at the United Nations. And for the first time since the end  of the Gulf War, he is able to report progress in his efforts to free Iraq from  the ring of economic and political sanctions that the United States has managed  to maintain. Clearly relishing the prospect that Iraq may soon be able to  export millions of barrels of oil, Aziz was only too pleased to describe the  ways and means of his successful diplomacy.     Eighteen times previously, the U.N. Security Council had met and ruled --  without dissent -- that Iraq had not complied with a post-war resolution  requiring that all its weapons of mass destruction be dismantled. These include  chemical and biological weapons and, of course, its nuclear-weapons program.  Without such a finding, and an agreement allowing a permanent outside  monitoring system, Iraq would continue under a world-wide embargo.     Until last year, the Iraqis were anything but cooperative. They repeatedly  challenged U.N. teams sent to inspect military sites and blustered about  violations of their sovereignty. But during a visit by a senior U.N. official  last summer, Aziz extracted a pledge that if Iraq were to cooperate, the United  Nations would allow Baghdad to resume unrestricted sale of its crude oil. With  oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia, a return of Iraqi oil exports will  mean a shift for commercial markets, not to mention Middle East politics.     The interview took place in an elegant townhouse on Manhattan\\'s upper East  Side, the official residence of the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations,  Nizar Hamdoon. Burly security guards patrol the hallways. Hussein\\'s ubiquitous  visage stares down in nearly every room. However, there was a slightly jarring  detail in the reception room where the conversation took place. On a small  table where Aziz placed his cigar and pipe and Hamdoon his cigarettes -- both  are big smokers -- was a silver-framed picture of Hamdoon, then ambassador in  Washington, with a smiling President George Bush.     Question: Do you believe the Security Council members see a shift in your  behavior?      Answer: We have been cooperating with the council. We have been implementing  U.N. resolutions -- but this has not been acknowledged in the past. Under the  pressure of the Americans, all the achievements of Iraq were obscured, were  denied. But that has come to an end. That biased attitude has come to an end.  Now more and more delegations in the Security Council are listening to us . . .  . The only obstinate position is the position of the United States.     Q: And Britain.      A: And, of course, Britain is supporting the United States. Though Britain is  showing a . . . limited understanding of the position of Iraq -- they listen to  us at least. I met with the British ambassador and we had a session with the  British delegation in which we explained what we have achieved. So this is a  bit positive.     Q: What about France? Key U.S. officials single out France, and go so far as  to say there has been coordination between France and Iraq on a common approach  to get the United Nations to lift the embargo.      A: Well, technically speaking, there has been no coordination . . . . But we  have explained our position to the French . . . and they showed understanding.     Q: In Washington, the French are singled out in part because two of their oil  companies are thought to be in a position to benefit from Iraq\\'s return to the  oil market.      A: Well, the French do have interests in Iraq . . . . It\\'s not strange that a  country like France would look at its legitimate interests with Iraq. We used  to do clean business with them and we intend to resume a clean business.     Q: You must be aware of the talk in the oil industry of deals you are on the  verge of signing with the French.      A: Yes, yes, this is correct.     Q: In your letter to the Security Council president, you only make an oblique  reference to an issue even the French emphasize -- the need for Iraq to  recognize Kuwait\\'s border. How do you plan to address this issue?      A: Well, I understand the French position and the position expressed by other  members . . . . (But) we said now the main issue for Iraq is to see that its  rights and its sovereignty are respected.     When the sovereignty of Iraq and the legitimate rights of Iraq . . . are  respected by the council, then Iraq will abide by the rules of international  law . . . .      Q: So, if I understand you clearly, the embargo against Iraq would have to be  lifted before you will address the question of the border between Iraq and  Kuwait.      A: Well, we are not putting it in the sense of before and after, because there  is a biased treatment by a number of members of the council -- mainly the  United States, first and foremost. This treatment is, first of all, infringing  on the sovereignty of Iraq by the implementation of no-fly zones in the north,  no-fly zones in the south, the interference in our internal affairs -- as it  has been officially acknowledged by (National Security Adviser) Tony Lake in  his article in \"Foreign Affairs\" -- without justification, against the letter  and spirit of U.N. resolutions, is blocking the lifting of the sanctions.     So in such circumstances, Iraq would like to see that its rights are respected  . . . . When that is the case, of course, Iraq would feel that it\\'s not being  threatened, Iraq would feel that it\\'s not being hurt. In such a climate Iraq  would be ready to consider solving all of the remaining problems.     Q: One problem the British and Americans have is Iraq\\'s seeming inability to  accept the permanence of Kuwait. For example, the Iraqi media continue to refer  to Kuwait as Iraq\\'s 19th province.      A: The media does not always represent the official position of the government  of Iraq. The media is the media.     Q: But it\\'s hard to believe --      A: I\\'m the spokesman of the Iraqi government. I have said that this chapter is  closed. This is the position of the government of Iraq. No official spokesman  on the side of Iraq contradicted what I said. About the media, . . . this talk  has stopped. If you will follow and observe what\\'s being said in the Iraqi  media, you wouldn\\'t find these things. . .     Q: Now that you\\'ve made some gains at the U.N., what is the next part of your  strategy, particularly toward the United States?      A: We would like to have normal relations with the United States of America.  We have said that we would not want to be enemies of the United States . . . .  But we think the United States has to reconsider its position because it\\'s  wrong, it\\'s illegal and its becoming a minority position in the Security  Council.     Q: As a practical matter, can you imagine the U.S. government, just three  years after the end of the war when the same leadership is still in place in  Baghdad, changing its policy toward Iraq and allowing you to sell massive  amounts of oil?      A: Well, that\\'s up to the Administration to decide. This is the right of Iraq  according to resolutions that were written by the United States itself. The  United States wrote those resolutions and we have implemented those  resolutions, so (if) they change their positions they will find themselves in  an awkward situation.     Q: OK, but I don\\'t understand how that gets you to your goal of selling oil.      A: I think that if the United States continues its position in blocking the  process in the Security Council, the very rationale, the raison d\\'etre of the  resolutions would be damaged. And they will lose their credibility. And when a  resolution loses its credibility because of the behavior of a single member,  then the result will be that international public opinion will change its  attitude toward Iraq. This will be similar to the unilateral position of the  United States vis-a-vis Cuba. The United States is imposing an embargo on Cuba  but the world is not imposing an embargo on Cuba.     You see, now Iraq is under embargo because there is a U.N. resolution. Even  the Philippines is implementing it. Argentina is implementing it. Venezuela,  Norway. But when Iraq implements its obligations according to the U.N.  resolution, then why should the international community boycott Iraq? It will  be just an American position, and if I were in the place of the American  Administration I wouldn\\'t love to find myself isolated and in the minority.     Q: Considering your experience in dealing with the previous Administration,  especially in the negotiations before the war, how do you rate the performance  of this Administration\\'s --      A: Amateurs!     Q: -- who are running day-to day policy.      A: They have this foolish policy of dual containment. That\\'s just a theory put  on paper -- but in practice who is being contained? First of all, Iran is not  contained by any means. Iran can buy whatever it wants from all over the world.  It has money. It has borders. It has ports. There is no containment on Iran.     And even Iraq is not contained in the sense Tony Lake mentioned in his  article. A nation is not a bunch of chickens to put in a cage and contain it  and feed it, give it the small amounts of food you would like to give it. This  is very arrogant and shallow kind of thinking.     Q: Is there a point when you will no longer take the diplomatic approach you  are taking now? Is there a time limit?      A: We are told, \"You have to comply with this resolution.\" We comply. Then, in  spite of the compliance, one powerful member says, \"No, I\\'m not going to do my  share.\" So then why should we comply with (other) resolutions? Then Iraq will  act according to what the situation is. They have to know that, you see.     Q: Do you have any doubt that the United States will do all it can to isolate  Iraq as long as the present regime is in power?      A: But Iraq is not isolated. The isolation is breaking gradually. Now we are  reviving our contact with many countries who were boycotting us in the past . .  . .      The other countries are not acting according to this obsession. Iraq is Iraq,  you know, whoever leads Iraq that\\'s up to the Iraqi people . . . . I don\\'t know  what\\'s behind this obsession in the position of the United States. They have  been just wasting their time and efforts and money trying to achieve what they  cannot achieve. The Iraqi people are not going to change their government  because some people in the White House or the State Department don\\'t like their  government.     Q: Does the government feel any pressure because of the economic situation ?     A: No, the pressure will not be in the direction to give concessions at the  expense of sovereignty. No, no the people of Iraq will not accept to give up  their sovereignty. Somalia didn\\'t accept to give up its sovereignty, and Iraq  is much better than Somalia.     Q: Do you now believe that in six months or so Iraqi oil will be back on the  international market?      A: Iraq cannot be excluded forever from that market. It\\'s up to the other  parties to accommodate themselves.     Q: How do you think other countries, like Saudi Arabia, feel about the return  of Iraq ?     A: They will have to accommodate themselves to reality. Iraq will be back.  Sooner or later, Iraq will be back.  ']}\n"
